Levels:

- Should probably be stored a text file for easy reference
- Loaded either all at once or upon first entry
- Levels stored in an table of "layout", "current objects"?

- Level has "remove object" when player leaves, as well as what object they had?
- Otherwise stays "stable" as an table when not in use

- Level =
--- BLOCKS AND DATA
--- CURRENT OBJECTS
--- CURRENT "DECORATIONS"

- Every "interactable" object is unique and stored differently
- Background objects can just be stored as part of the level and not externally shown
