Levels:

- Should probably be stored a text file for easy reference
- Loaded either all at once or upon first entry
- Levels stored in an table of "layout", "current objects"?

- Level has "remove object" when player leaves, as well as what object they had?
- Otherwise stays "stable" as an table when not in use

- Level =
--- BLOCKS AND DATA
--- CURRENT OBJECTS
--- CURRENT "DECORATIONS"

- Every "interactable" object is unique and stored differently
- Background objects can just be stored as part of the level and not externally shown


Objects:
- Inherited
- Basic features:
--- Current movement vector
--- Current position
--- :setMovement(vector); set movement vector directly
--- :accel(vector); add this to the movement vector
--- :goto(vector); warp directly to this position
--- Maybe :warp(stage, vector)? to move to a new stage
--- :draw(), to draw it
--- :update, to update animations / vectors
--- :hitbox(), to draw hitbox(es)
